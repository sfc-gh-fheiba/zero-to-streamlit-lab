# Zero to Streamlit

## Lab Guide
You can find the lab guide that builds the code in this repo step by step here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RbKxQauxVDNeUaYpOPNBM71RaJLv8YcoWa0a1kgUoC0. This Github repo is provided for internal Snowflake folks who want to quickly set up the final form of the code in the lab guide.

## Lab Overview
This Snowflake lab will walk you through building a full Streamlit web application from scratch, from ingesting/transforming Snowflake data to charting and writing user inputs back to Snowflake. We aim to get you quickly acquainted with Streamlit’s intuitive methods for creating scalable web pages with very few lines of code by giving you as many reusable code snippets as possible to get you started on building your own use cases.

## What You'll Learn 
- The exercises in this lab will walk you through the steps to: 
- Get familiar with Streamlit layout and design options
- Interact with Snowflake data through Snowpark dataframes
- Manipulate and transform Snowpark dataframes and use the results in Streamlit
- Build Streamlit metrics, tables, and charts through a few short lines of code
- Differentiate between Snowpark dataframes and Pandas dataframes
- Accept inputs from the user through buttons, radio buttons, and dropdown select options
- Set up session state variables to keep track of these inputs throughout the user’s session
- Write back these saved inputs to Snowflake tables and verify they’ve been written
